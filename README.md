# PBMC-Specific-Single-Cell-RNA-seq-Clustering-and-Visualization-with-Scanpy

This project used the SCANPY Python library to cluster and visualize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Key steps included data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction via PCA, neighborhood graph construction and UMAP visualization, cell clustering using the Leiden algorithm, and marker gene identification to annotate the cell types.
